## What Is This
A macro keyboard that controls the swim meet scoring software commonly used in American high-school and college swim meets. It simplifies operation of the software by pulling out 13 most used functionalities as dedicated keys, achieving one-key operation.

The device works by triggering keyboard shortcuts compatible with the swim meet software when a corresponding button is pushed. It is automatically recognized by most operating systems as an HID keyboard with no drivers required.
